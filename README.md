# Data Oriented Programming By Yehonathan Sharvit

## Chapter 2
Complexity and Flexibility in programming that's the message I am getting from Chapter 2.

A system should be separated into two distinct parts Code Modules and Data entities
* Code Modules should be stateless and the relations between Code Modules should be of Usage alone.
meaning that there should be no inheritance hierarchy between Code Modules and no data encapsulation in code modules either.
